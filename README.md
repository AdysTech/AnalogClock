# AnalogClock
A simple Analog clock for windows that can float on your screen. Written long back in VC++

##What it is?
Its a small application written in VC++, it will float on the desktop showing time! I wrote it in 2006-7, mostly to learn VC++ and Win32 APIs. 

Also at that time at work I did not have admin rights, and Windows XP was not letting me see a simple calender to look up day of the week. So this application has a Calender View.
I had to learn a heck of a lot with image processing, Julian day, Gregorian quadricentennial etc :P
